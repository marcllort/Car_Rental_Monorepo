# RabbitMQ
 This directory contains some configurations for the rabbitMQ docker image. 
 
This image is only used for local development, so in case some of this configurations want to be ported to the production version, the same configurations will have to be applied to the RabbitMQ instance running in the Kubernetes cluster.
